# YouTube Clone

Pure HTML AND CSS project that I built while learning/practicing concepts like flexbox, grid, position relative/absolute, fixed header and sidebar, and much more.

Just like the name says, this is a YouTube clone, so there is a header and sidebar similar to what you would find on YouTube and a grid of 12 video previews with thumbnails and video info.
